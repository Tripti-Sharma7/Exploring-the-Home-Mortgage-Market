# Analyzing-the-Home-Mortgage-Market

The analysis of a dataset containing over 13 million mortgage applications between 2016 and 2017 under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) by multiple financial institutions revealed several disparities and trends. Overall we observe that the dataset is biased towards males, with income disparities among different races. Loan amounts applied for tend to increase with income, but there is a widening gap in average loan amounts applied for by Asians and Whites. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides the highest loan amounts to its applicants. Additionally, Debt-to-income ratios vary across states, with Californians having higher ratios than states on the east coast. These findings emphasize the need for addressing disparities, investigating lending practices, and economic factors to improve underwriting processes and increase profitability.
